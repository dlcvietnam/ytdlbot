```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec mysql bash

mysql -u root -p

> create database ytdl;
```

### 3.2.2 Setup flower db in `ytdlbot/ytdlbot/data`

Required if you enable celery and want to monitor the workers.
**NOT WORKING**

```shell
{} ~ python3
Python 3.9.9 (main, Nov 21 2021, 03:22:47)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dbm;dbm.open("flower","n");exit()
```

## 3.3 Tidy docker-compose.yml

In `flower` service section, you may want to change your basic authentication username password and publish port.

You can also limit CPU and RAM usage by adding a `deploy` key, use `--compatibility` when deploying.

```docker
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 1500M
```

## 4. run

### 4.1. standalone mode

If you only want to run the mode without any celery worker and VIP mode, you can just start `ytdl` service

```shell
docker-compose up -d ytdl
```

### 4.2 VIP mode

You'll have to start MySQL and redis to support VIP mode, subscription and settings.

```
docker-compose up -d mysql redis ytdl
```

### 4.3 Celery worker mode

**NOT WORKING**
Firstly, set `ENABLE_CELERY` to true. And then, on one machine:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

On the other machine:

```shell
docker-compose -f worker.yml up -d
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è You should not publish Redis directly on the internet. ‚ö†Ô∏è**
